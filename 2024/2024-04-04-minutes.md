## Minutes

### Announcements:
* CycloneDX v1.6 frozen. Release ready – just waiting for documentation.
* Press release going out next week

### ECMA Standard Document Review
* Review four missing sections prior to next meeting:
    * Scope
    * Conformance
    * Normative References
    * Terms and Definitions
### Specification review
* Background
    * Documentation dynamically generated from JSON schema
    * Few remaining things need to do script to generate complete docs
    * Some incomplete documentation – will be resolved
    * Refer to progress by referring to “location” not page numbers, section numbers. b/c can vary.
* Introduction and Object Model
    * Taken straight from authoritative guide for SBOM
    * Not part of the specification
* Introduction Section
    * xBom Capabilities – Hardware,Manufacture, etc.
    * CDXA and CBOM are new attestations for 1.6
    * Release notes often contain security related things. 
  * **Metadata**: Who is the bill of manufacturer, supplier, component lifecycles etc of the BOM,
  * **Components** are the inventory of what is shipped – **asserts** identity of components (via Purl, cpe, tc) and simultaneously substantiate why asserting that identity through evidence
      * Pedigree - open source is the ultimate supply chain
  * **Services**: typically URL but no standard way to identify service
  * **Dependencies**: tie components and services together
  * **Compositions**: define the completeness of things – if have OS can define completeness of BOMs but if proprietary software cannot necessarily describe completeness
  * **Vulnerabilities**: whether CVE, Snyk, commercial CVA / research teams – not necessarily in national vulnerability database – specify the source and risk ratings (CycloneDX version of VEX) - proof of exploit
  * **Formulation: **how something came to be, different but very related concepts – recipe card – both the declared as well as the observed formulation of how something came to be
  * **Annotations: **manual use case – lawyers looking a things, automated era – manual use case wasn't an initial focus. A lot of value having components – pull from other spec, compatible with other spec – human commentary on any object of the BOM
  * **Definitions: **PCI security council, transformed some of their existing standard – all OWASP standards moving forward will be in this format –
  * **Declarations: **once we have standards in machine readable format - can make attestations | digital signatures and manual signatures
  * **Extensions**: lots of ways to extend CyCloneDX
* Serialization Formats
  * JSON, XML, Protobuf
  * Can look to align all in 2.0

* 1.0 CycloneDX Bill of Materials Standard
  * Identify of the BOM – OBOM might reference an HBOM etc
* 2.0 BOM Metadata
  * Manufacture (deprecated and misspled 1.6) and manufacturer
  * Example of SBOMs – have an entire repository that could show examples – this would be helpful
* Suggestions
  * References  / links >> cross reference
  * Linking to repositories of examples
