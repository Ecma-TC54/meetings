## Minutes
* In-person meetings
    * Steve will have a session on CycloneDX at an OpenSSF conference, hopefully will bring people into working with us, especially on TG1 and TG2
    * Dan and Olle will be at OWASP AppSec Lisbon, come say hi
* Formulation - lead: Matt Rutkowski (/formulation/)
    * The goal is to document the workflows and processes to constructing an artifact
    * IBM has some very complicated build processes, and I wanted to be able to capture them. So we need multiple workflows.
    * Steve: /formulation/[]/components/[] has the wrong description. Same for services.
    * Reviewed each field of /formulation/
    * Discussion about JSON schema semantics for arrays and ordering
        * Olle: From the JSON Schema: array
        * Arrays are used for ordered elements. In JSON, each element in an array may be of a different type.
        * [https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/array](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/array)
    * Olle: There are no MBOM examples in [https://github.com/CycloneDX/bom-examples](https://github.com/CycloneDX/bom-examples)
        * Steve: Matt should be working on an MBOM Guide later this year. If anyone wants to help with this effort, it would be greatly appreciated.
    * Question:
        * Jan: Does the order of workflows matter? Use case: python, not ordered lists but sets. Answer: Timestamp exist but not required, can describe workflows and tasks as a design. No ordering implied but can use them if things make sense and can be used to audit.
    * Question from Dan: How widely adopted/adoptable is this?
        * Matt, Steve: The model is designed to be automatable, can fit into makefiles, not perfect/opinionated
        * Dan: Could we work with OpenSSF here, where they are recommending SLSA with a less rich formulation model?
        * Matt: We should get started with reference implementations to get things bootstrapped, rather than broadcasting information
    * Steve: Formulation could include all sorts of things used in deriving/training/setting up something Matt: including AI
* “How did I train my AI model?”
* “How did I build my FIP2-l3 validated code?”
* OEJ: /formulation/workflows/resourceReferences have “undefined” type
* Note to Transparency Exchange API (TG 1): Support BOM linking over multiple files? (OEJ)
