## Minutes

Promotions

* Patents potentially ready by this time next month –
    * Requests to include patent information in specification
    * WIPO and stakeholders ST96 specification
    * Including optional patent information – not applying patent on CycloneDX

Threat modeling



* Table of sontributions keeps growing
* Challenge – MVP of the spec that can grow and more threat modeling capabilities are added in future releases – captures all the different methodologies
* Taking the approach – data included in threat model should also be able to reside independtly – use cases - consumers of SBOMs
* Compexity

Blueprints



* Focused on behaviors – dangerous types – progressing faster than threat modeling –
* POC in next 2 weeks

Sustainability



* Still unsure will be part of cycloneDX –
* Consulting with CHAOSS folks – making progress of Google doc
*
* Expanding on CHAOSS metric models
* Invited in specialities - mental health - represent positive mental health

Patents



* Work going well - asking WIPO for a review

Task Group Updates



* TG1 - FOSDEM preparation
* TG2
    * FOSDEM - funding SBOMs – a lot of CycloneDX everywhere
    * Skipped a beat b/c of FOSDEM
    * Slow but steady progress – a lot of the work removing words from spec
    * Brief and crisp
    * RedHat helpful
    * Core spec - still on track for Q1 – trying to stay as focused as possible
    * Triage issues/PRs – keep coming - not out of the woods but doing steady progress
    * Question - to vote ECMA mid-year – March 5-6 – get document to us in next 2 weeks - not possible
* TG3
    * Hoping to have draft spec by June GA – but if not Dec GA

OWASP Community Calendar

ClearlyDefined &lt;> CycloneDX



* CD - focused clearly defining licences – they have an API can get alot of the license info
* Cyclone SPDX license identified and expressions – natural fit to collaborate
* For license specifically – they rely on SPDX license ID and expressions –
* Collaboration opportunities – possibly with SPDX regarding licesning – wider impact - opportunities to integrate CD with other OWASP project – eg Dependecy Trck - how consume and analysis BOM – fairly large adoption –
* Its a little less clear – from the CyclineDX perspective–  however there is certainly transparency exchange API - to provide integration there as well
* Still in discovery phase – how we can potentially collaborate
* If anyone is interested – let Steve and Alyssa know. We will add you to the channel
* Alyssa to share CD outreach meeting
* Can someone explain what clearlydefined provides that SPDX identifiers and expressions do not?
    * AFAIK the data from ClearlyDefined is cetranlized/hosted code scanning results, as well as concluded(human-reviewd?) data.
    * SPDX license expressiosn is one way to express the data they have, but this undertaking is not about the data format - it is about the data.
* Copyright statement in Scancode - -data really useful – copyrights are clear text of copyrights
* Also get the concluded license result (at least I was told - never actually tested this)
* Can envision how this can be useful for SBOM dependency tools – still in discovery phase – what does collaboration look like
* Weve had challenges with national vuleraiblty database – taken donw NVD – reflection of the amotn of orgs that use thse tools – lack of funding scalable infrastructure to account for massive amount of traffic

Sustainability WG



* Ecosystems Funds
* This is an Ecosystems talk at FOSDEM: [https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5576-open-source-funding-you-re-doing-it-wrong/](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5576-open-source-funding-you-re-doing-it-wrong/)
* [https://funds.ecosyste.ms](https://funds.ecosyste.ms)

Standards and Coming Features



* BSI asked for own flavor of SBOMs
* Version of 2 of standards – showed features we lack and need to face
* License expressions – issues currently in spec
* Extraneous components - not actually shipping wit products but want to distribute with SBOM –
    * Worked on for over a year
    * Early March
    * One example – runtime dependency
* https://github.com/CycloneDX/guides/issues/29
