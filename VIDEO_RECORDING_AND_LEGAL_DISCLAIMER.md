# TC54 video recording, meeting minutes and legal disclaimer

During the TC meeting, a video recording (comment-by-comment video recording captured by teleconference tool i.e. Zoom and TC54 participants) will be taken and meeting minutes (using Google Docs) will be written. The intention is to capture the various points of view of the committee members, which helps all members evolve proposals based on feedback received and understand the rationale of decisions taken.

TC54 participants are encouraged to edit written meeting minutes for accuracy (where the goal is to accurately reflect the intention of the point being made), and to delete comments of theirs which they do not want to be recorded (e.g., due to risk of misunderstanding, inclusion of personal information, or any other reason). Edits may be made during the meeting by editing the Google Doc meeting minutes as it is composed.

If a participant makes a comment in the committee meeting and does not remove it from the notes, they are consenting for it to be published. A purpose of the video recording and meeting minutes is not to collect or distribute personal information; if without consenting someoneâ€™s personal information is included in the video and meeting minutes, the TC54 management will rectify or remove it upon request.
